Instruction for Deploying to Prod Server:
Create a new Ubuntu VM
Region same as your jenkins
Ubuntu Boot Disk
Tick "http server" to open port 80
SSH onto that VM
Install docker 
curl https://get.docker.com | sudo bash
Create a new jenkins user
sudo adduser jenkins
Add the jenkins user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
Swap into the jenkins user and configure docker:
sudo su jenkins
docker login
On your JENKINS server swap into the jenkins user and generate a new ssh key
sudo su jenkins
ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
On the PROD server, as the jenkins user, create the file for the public key to go in and paste the pub key
mkdir ~/.ssh
cd ~/.ssh
touch authorized_keys
nano authorized_keys
On the Jenkins server: check the ssh connection
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa jenkins@PRODIP
