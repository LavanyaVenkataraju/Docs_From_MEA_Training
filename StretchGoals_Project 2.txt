Stretch Goal 1:

Put the flask app behind an NGINX container using proxy pass

Considerations:
You will now need a Network for your containers
You will need a new folder for your 'nginx.conf' and it's 'Dockerfile'
Use previous knowledge of Task1 to write the nginx.conf

Stretch Stretch Goal 1:

Configure your nginx.conf so you no longer have to type /index.html at the end of your IP to access the app

Your IP to access the app should go from:
 http://IPADDRESS:80/index.html
To:
 http://IPADDRESS:80




Stretch Goal 2:

Configure a Test server and use Groovy if statements to deploy to a different server based on which branch you're on. 

dev branch -> Test
main branch -> Prod

Use this Repositorie's Jenkinsfile to inform your changes:

You will need 2 different Jenkins Jobs one looking at main, you should already have, one looking at the new branch dev
